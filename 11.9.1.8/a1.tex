PROBLEM STATEMENT (11.9.1 8th question): Find the 7th term of the sequence where the nth term of the sequence is given by \(a_n = \frac{n^2}{2^n}\).

\textbf{ANSWER:}

Consider the sequence \(a_n\) defined as:
\begin{align}
    a_n &= \frac{n^2}{2^n}
\end{align}

Let \(x(n)\) be the sequence, i.e., \(a_n = x(n)\).

Now, let's find the seventh term (\(x(7)\)):
\begin{align}
    x(7) &= \frac{7^2}{2^7} \\
    x(7) &= \frac{49}{128}
\end{align}

Therefore, the seventh term (\(x(7)\)) is \(\frac{49}{128}\).

\begin{table}[h]

    \caption{Parameters Table}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
        \hline
        \(x(n)\) & \(\frac{n^2}{2^n}\) \\ \\
        \(x(7)\) & \(\frac{49}{128}\) \\
        \hline   
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Z-transform of the sequence \(x(n) = \frac{n^2}{2^n}\) is given by:
\begin{align}
    X(z) &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x(n) z^{-n} \\
    X(z) &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n^2}{2^n} z^{-n}
\end{align}

To find \(X(z)\) for the seventh term (\(x(n)\)), substitute \(n = 7\):
\begin{align}
    X(z) &= \frac{7^2}{2^7} z^{-7} \\
    X(z) &= \frac{49}{128} z^{-7}
\end{align}

The Region of Convergence (ROC) for a Z-transform expression is the set of values for which the series converges. For the Z-transform \(X(z) = \frac{49}{128} z^{-7}\), the ROC is the set of complex values \(z\) for which the series converges.

In this case, the Z-transform term \(z^{-7}\) indicates that the ROC includes all values of \(z\) except possibly 0, as \(z = 0\) would result in division by zero.

So, the ROC for \(X(z) = \frac{49}{128} z^{-7}\) is the entire complex plane excluding 0.
